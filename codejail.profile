# This is not a complete and secure apparmor profile! Do not use this
# in any deployed environment (even a staging environment) without
# careful inspection and modification to fit your needs.
#
# Failure to apply a secure apparmor profile *will* likely result in a
# compromise of your environment by an attacker.
#
# We may at some point make this file good enough for confinement in
# production, but for now it is only intended to be used in devstack.

# Sets standard variables used by abstractions/base, later. Controlled
# by OS, see /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/global for contents.

# Require that the system understands the feature set that this policy was written
# for. If we didn't include this, then on Ubuntu >= 22.04, AppArmor might assume
# the wrong feature set was requested, and some rules might become too permissive.

# profile isn't present in the outer one.
